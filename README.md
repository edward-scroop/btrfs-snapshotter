# Btrfs-Snapshotter
This is a personal project to learn about hashing algorithms by implementing them in rust. I intend to model the
behaviour of the GNU coreutils cksum program but as it is not a full rewrite i might not implement all behaviours.

## Getting Started
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
The only prerequisite is to be using an x86\_64 platform as it is the only platform i am currently targeting.
